    <h1>What is a gamebook?</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>gamebook</strong> is a work of <i>printed</i> fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices.<br> The narrative
        branches along <sup>various</sup> paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages.<br /> Production of new gamebooks
        in the West decreased dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away from print based media.<br>
